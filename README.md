This command-line Tic tac toe game is built using Java and object-oriented design concepts. The fully functional game currently supports 
a 3 x 3 board with 2 players able to play at a time. But the code is completely extensible and can add more feature by extendind and adding top
of the current code.

The game also checks for input values which are invalid and handles the logic if there is a tie.
Few snippets of the game running is attached below
